<p>it won't work for all, so you may try out float32le instead or any of default sampling formats:
s16le, s16be, s24le, s24be, s24-32le, s24-32be, s32le, s32be float32le, float32be, ulaw, alaw

Also depending on the endianness of the CPU the
formats s16ne, s16re, s24ne, s24re, s24-32ne, s24-32re, s32ne, s32re,
float32ne, float32re (for native, resp. reverse endian) are available
